Welcome to the Teach Access Online Portal! This resource is part of the Teach Access Initiative, and provides best practices for making accessible mobile and web apps. This portal currently provides basic training for developers and designers, with more disciplines to come! If you are new to accessibility, you've come to the right place - this portal will help you get a solid footing on accessibility via hands-on tutorials and useful reference guides. Follow the instructions below for using and interacting with the portal.

1. You can use the left and right arrow keys to navigate through the slides.

2. Each slide has some core concepts, code samples, and one or more exercises. After you complete an exercise,
use the verify button to check whether your solution is correct.

3. You can also verify the code sample output by reading it in Chrome with VoiceOver - Apple's built-in screen reader. Here are some instructions for navigating with VoiceOver:
  * <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> turns VoiceOver on/off
  * <kbd>tab</kbd> navigates to an interactive element
  * <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>right arrow</kbd> (repeatedly) navigates to the next element
  * <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd> (repeatedly) navigates by headings

4. When verifying with VoiceOver, use Chrome on a Mac for the best experience. However, the "Verify" button provided after each exercise will work with any browser/OS combination.

5.     ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications, a W3C standard for building accessible user interfaces on the web.
