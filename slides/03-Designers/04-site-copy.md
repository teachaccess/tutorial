The content you write for your website or application matters a great deal for its usability and accessibility. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines recommends that you use a reading ability equivalent of a <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#qr-meaning-supplements">lower secondary education level</a>. That's a good, general rule of thumb to go by. Here are a few more:

- Avoid using directional language like “below” and “left/right.” These require that you can see the visual layout of the page.
- Use alt-text for images. Alt-text describes the contents of an image to someone who is visually impaired and using a screen reader. If your designs include images that you've created (not user-generated images), you need to provide alt-text in your front end layer.
- Provide explanatory and context-specific text where possible. Explanatory text consists of short text strings that describe an interface element’s function (ex: if you have a search button that looks like a magnifying glass, you might consider adding an on-hover tooltip of "Search").

Take note that if your website or application includes other text artifacts like PDFs, you may need to provide unique accessibility support for those media.
