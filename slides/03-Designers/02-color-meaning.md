Color blindness is the inability or decreased ability to see color or perceive 
color differences. [Approximately 4.5% of the world's 
population](https://nei.nih.gov/health/color_blindness/facts_about) are color 
blind to some degree. In order to ensure that someone with color blindness can 
successfully use your product, you cannot rely completely on color alone to 
communicate information. By extension, using colors or patterns alone to 
indicate something will not be accessible to a blind users. In instances where 
you are using color as an indicator (for instance, green for something active 
and grey for something inactive), include a text equivalent description for the 
state.

Here's an example where providing a very simple texture to a bar chart will aid in readability and understanding for someone with decreased color perception.
