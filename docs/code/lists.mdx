Semantic lists help screen readers understand the type of the element and the
number of items in the element, and provide
easier navigation via list commands specific to screen readers.

## Semantic Lists Using HTML

HTML provides tags that express lists. Most likely you are already familiar with the `ul` (unordered list) and `ol` (ordered list) tags.

In the example below, the list is correctly announced by screen readers as a list with three items.

1. Turn on VoiceOver with `Cmd` + `F5`.
2. Press `Ctrl` + `Opt` + `Cmd` + `h` repeatedly until you have jumped to the Editor Output heading.
3. Press `Ctrl` + `Opt` + `Right Arrow`.

VoiceOver will announce ‘List 3 items’.
```jsx live
<ul>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Bread</li>
</ul>
```

## Semantic List Using ARIA Roles
The list below uses ARIA roles to express the semantics of a list from a generic `div` structure. This approach to expressing list structure can be used if it is not possible to use the native HTML list tags.

Notice that the default list styling is not applied. That is because the browser’s default stylesheet targets `ul` and `ol` tags.

In the example below, the list is correctly announced by screen readers as a list with three items.

```jsx live
<div role="list">
  <div role="listitem">Sea</div>
  <div role="listitem">Surf</div>
  <div role="listitem">Sun</div>
</div>
```

## Unsemantic List exercise

Update the example below so that the items are expressed as a list. The easiest way to make this semantic is to use a list tag. If that is not possible, wrap the elements in a container and give it a role of `list`. The individual items will need to be identified with a role of `listitem`.

```jsx live
<div>
  <span>A house of straw</span>
  <span>A house of sticks</span>
  <span>A house of bricks</span>
</div>
```

import { VerifyButton } from "../_util/VerifyButton.mdx";

<VerifyButton
  error="You should create a wrapping element for the list. Either a 'ul', 'li' OR a 'div' with the role 'list'."
  checkExercise={() => {
    const divs = document.querySelectorAll('div[role="list"]');
    const spans = document.querySelectorAll('div[role="listitem"]');
    const uls = document.querySelectorAll("ul");
    const lis = document.querySelectorAll("li");
        return (divs.length === 1 && spans.length === 3) || (uls.length == 1 && lis.length == 3);
  }}
/>
