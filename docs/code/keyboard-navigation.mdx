Make all interactive elements work with a keyboard. For example, make sure a
button that you activate with a click is also in the keyboard tab sequence and that pressing enter or space
activates it. Set the `tabindex` attribute to `0` to include an element in the
browser's keyboard tab sequence. If you want an element out of sequence, set
its `tabindex` to `-1` and use JavaScript to control its focus and tab
sequence, and related keyboard events. We do not recommend using `tabindex`
values greater than `0` even though browsers support them. Note that HTML links
and input elements have an implied `tabindex` of `0`.

## Semantic Button

The button below uses a semantic `button` tag and is correctly announced by
screen readers. If you are on a Mac, turn on VoiceOver and tab to the
button. You will hear the name of the element and the element type announced
by VoiceOver.

<Editor>
  {`<button onclick="alert('Take a HIKE!')">
  Submit
</button>`}
</Editor>

## Unsemantic Button exercise

The button below is constructed using an unsemantic `div`. The easiest way to
make this semantic is to use a real `button` or `input` tag. Here is another way. In the
example below, add

1. `role='button'`
1. `tabindex='0'`

Verify with VoiceOver that you can tab to the button and hear the button name and the fact
that it is a button element. Note that you would need to add an `onkeypress` or `onkeydown` handler to the button so you can tab to the button and press <kbd>enter</kbd> to activate it using just the keyboard.

import { Editor } from "../_util/Editor.mdx";

<Editor
  checkExercise={(result) => {
    const [button] = document.getElementsByClassName("customButton");
    const isValid =
      button.hasAttribute("tabindex") &&
      button.getAttribute("tabindex") === "0" &&
      button.getAttribute("role") === "button";
    if (!isValid) {
      return "It doesn't look like your custom button is accessible yet.";
    }
  }}
>
  {`<div class='customButton'>
  Submit
</div>`}
</Editor>
