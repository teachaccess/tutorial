title: Using this tutorial
---

Welcome to the Teach Access Tutorial! This resource is part of the Teach Access Initiative, and provides best practices for making accessible mobile and web apps. This tutorial currently provides basic training for developers and designers, with more disciplines to come! If you are new to accessibility, you've come to the right place - the following material will help you get a solid footing on accessibility via hands-on exercises and useful reference guides. Follow the instructions below for using and interacting with the tutorial.

1.  You can use the left and right arrow keys to navigate through the slides.

2.  Each slide has some core concepts, code samples, and one or more exercises. After you complete an exercise,
    use the verify button to check whether your solution is correct.

3.  You can also verify the code sample output using VoiceOver - Apple's built-in screen reader (other screen readers work too). Here are some instructions for navigating with VoiceOver:

    - <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> turns VoiceOver on/off
    - <kbd>tab</kbd> navigates to an interactive element
    - <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>right arrow</kbd> (repeatedly)
      navigates to the next element
    - <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd>
      (repeatedly) navigates by headings
      <br /><br />
      **Please note:** the majority of people who use a screen reader [prefer JAWS or NVDA on a Windows machine](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/#primary). WebAim has great articles about testing your code with [NVDA](https://webaim.org/articles/nvda/) and [JAWS.](https://webaim.org/articles/jaws/)


4.  When verifying with VoiceOver, use Chrome on a Mac for the best experience. However, the "Verify" button provided after each exercise will work with any browser/OS combination.

5.  ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications, a W3C standard for
    building accessible user interfaces on the web.
