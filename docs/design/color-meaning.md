Color blindness is the inability or decreased ability to see color or perceive
color differences. [Approximately 4.5% of the world's population](https://nei.nih.gov/health/color_blindness/facts_about) are color blind to some degree. In order to ensure that someone with color blindness can
successfully use your product, you cannot rely completely on color alone to
communicate information. By extension, using colors or patterns alone to
indicate something will not be accessible to blind users. In instances where
you are using color as an indicator (for instance, green for something active
and grey for something inactive), include a text equivalent description for the
state.

Here's an example where providing a very simple texture to a bar chart will aid in readability and understanding for someone with decreased color perception.
