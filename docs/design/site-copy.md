The content you write for your website or application matters a great deal for
its usability and accessibility. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
recommends that you use a reading ability equivalent of a [lower secondary
education level](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#qr-meaning-supplements).
That's a good, general rule of thumb to go by. Here are a few more:

- Avoid using directional language like “below” and “left/right.” These require
  that you can see the visual layout of the page.
- Use alt-text for images. Alt-text describes the contents of an image to
  someone who is visually impaired and using a screen reader. If your designs
  include images that you've created (not user-generated images), you need to
  provide alt-text in your front end layer.
- Provide explanatory and context-specific text where possible. Explanatory text
  consists of short text strings that describe an interface element’s function
  (ex: if you have a search button that looks like a magnifying glass, you
  might consider adding an on-hover tooltip of "Search").

Take note that if your website or application includes other text artifacts like
PDFs, you may need to provide unique accessibility support for those media.
