People with low vision use browser zoom tools and assistive technology such as
[ZoomText](http://www.aisquared.com/products/zoomtext/) to increase the size of
content on the screen. This exercise shows you the difference between zooming
all the content versus zooming just the text on the page.

## Text Size

For people with low vision, it is important to support the ability to increase
text size without text overlapping or getting truncated. To test, use your browser's
built-in zoom or text-resize feature to zoom and make sure text is still readable.
If you are building for the mobile web, please don't disable pinch and zoom.

[WCAG guidelines recommend allowing zooming up to 200% without loss of 
content.](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-scale)

[More on fonts and accessibility in the WebAIM 
site.](http://webaim.org/techniques/fonts/#font_size)

For the exercise below, you will need a browser like Safari that allows you to
increase just the text size instead of zooming in the whole page. On Safari,
go to View and Zoom Text Only and then select Zoom In from the same menu. You
will notice that the words bleed outside the box below. Try fixing this example
by specifying the width and height as relative units, such as ems. Set the height
to 3em and width to 10em and verify your answers.

```jsx live

<div
          id='container' 
          style = {{all:"none",
            border:"2px solid green",
            fontSize: "100%",
            width: "1000px",
            height: "50px",
            border: "thin solid gray",
            margin: "10px"}}
          >
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
        </div>

```


<VerifyButton
  error="It doesn't seem like the height and width are set to the right ems"
  style = {{
            ...styling
  }}
  checkExercise={() => {
  
    var container = document.querySelector('#container');
    return(container.style.height === '3em' && container.style.width === '10em')
     
  }}
></VerifyButton>
