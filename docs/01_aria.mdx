Web sites were simple, accessible documents in the early days of the Internet. But accessibility was lost when web sites became applications. [Accessible Rich Internet Aplications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) (ARIA) extends HTML to restore accessibility in web applications. 

ARIA is a set of HTML attributes for developers to control the information surfaced by assistive technology. ARIA defines an element's  label, state, properties, and  role. 

ARIA is a powerful tool and must be used with care. The [first rule of ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1) is to not use ARIA. Use semantic HTML and augment with ARIA. However, we often need to use ARIA to extend HTML or fix inaccessible code. 

ARIA does not make your application accessible. It makes it understandable. You can't put role="button" on a div and expect it to work with a keyboard and screen reader. Adding role="button" simply tells assistive technology to expect div is actually a button.

### Commonly used ARIA attributes
- [Roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#roles): button, img, link
- [Properties[(https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#global_states)]: aria-label, aria-live, aria-haspopup
- States: aria-required, aria-selected, aria-expanded
- [Landmarks](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#landmark_roles): main, banner, search, region
- [Complex roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#widget_roles): alert, tablist, table, toolbar

You will find ARIA examples within the Tutorial pages.
